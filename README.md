# Working Capital Analysis Study

## Introduction

This research delves into the critical realm of working capital management, specifically focusing on two prominent companies, Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) and Indian Tobacco Company (ITC). The objective is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of their working capital dynamics and its impact on corporate performance.

# Working Capital Explained

Working capital, in essence, denotes the capital necessary for covering day-to-day expenses or short-term asset financing. It encompasses the investment a company makes in short-term assets like cash and marketable securities. Net current assets or working capital, calculated by subtracting current liabilities from current assets, is crucial for measuring operational and financial efficiency. Maintaining an adequate amount of cash and lines of credit is essential for a company's continuous business operations.

Symbolically, it can be expressed as:
Working capital=current assets−current liabilities

## Current Assets:
These are assets convertible into cash within one year or less, including cash, bank accounts, debtors, bill receivables, prepaid expenses, and outstanding incomes.

## Current Liabilities:
Liabilities payable within a year or less, such as creditors, outstanding bills, bank overdrafts, bills payable, short-term loans, outstanding expenses, and advances.

## Types of Working Capital

1. **Gross Working Capital:**
   The total investment in current assets.
   Gross Working Capital=Total Current Assets

2. **Net Working Capital:**
   The difference between current assets and current liabilities, with positive or negative results based on the comparison.
   Net Working Capital=Current Assets−Current Liabilities

3. **Fixed Working Capital:**
   The minimum amount required for ongoing business activities.

4. **Temporary Working Capital:**
   Additional working capital needed for situations requiring more than the permanent working capital.

## Research Gap

Upon reviewing existing literature, a notable gap emerged. While numerous studies explore working capital, there is a distinct absence of research specifically focusing on HUL and ITC for the selected period. In response, this study titled "A Study on Working Capital Analysis of Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) and Indian Tobacco Company (ITC)" has been initiated.

## Need of the Study

Working capital serves as the lifeblood of any business organization. Smooth and successful operations are contingent upon sufficient working capital. Presently, the capital market is grappling with a recession, posing challenges for companies to meet daily operational fund requirements. This study aims to address this issue, offering insights into the current capital positions of HUL and ITC. It also aids creditors in understanding the companies' ability to meet credit obligations. Beyond this, the study serves as a valuable resource for students, bridging classroom knowledge with practical applications.

## Objective of the Study

- **To study the financial statements of selected companies:** This involves a thorough analysis of the financial statements of HUL and ITC.
- **To study the various components of working capital:** Theoretical aspects of working capital will be explored, supplemented by an analysis of annual reports.
- **To compare the working capital management of selected companies:** Comparative analysis will be conducted using various accounting ratios based on the annual reports of HUL and ITC.

## Research Methodology

- **Research Design:** The study adopts a descriptive and analytical research design, aligning with specific objectives and utilizing extensive data from selected FMCG companies.
- **Collection of Data:** Primary reliance on secondary data from reports, journals, magazines, newspapers, websites, periodicals, annual financial reports, and corporate sustainability reports.
- **Duration of Study:** A four-year data span, from the financial year 2018-19 to 2021-2022, will be considered.
- **Selection Criteria:** HUL and ITC, chosen based on their highest revenue as of March 31, 2022, are the focus of the comparative analysis.
- **Tools to be Used:** Various accounting tools such as liquidity ratio, profitability ratio, turnover ratio, leverage ratio, and valuation ratio will be employed for data analysis. Results will be presented through tables, graphs, etc.
